***Maze Solving Robot***

This repository contains code hosts the code and documentation for an IoT maze-solving robot project. The primary objective of this project is to develop a robot capable of autonomously navigating through a maze or labyrinth using various sensors, actuators and intelligent algorithms.

**Components:**

***1. Arduino Board:*** An Arduino Uno microcontroller board is used as the brain of the robot. It controls the robot's movements, processes sensor data and executes decision-making algorithms.

***2.Motor Driver:*** A motor driver circuit or module is used to interface between the Arduino and the motors that drive the robot's wheels. It provides the necassary power and control signals to move the robot forward, backward and turn.

***Sensors:*** 
      
      i) Ultrasonic Sensor: Used for obstacle detection and mapping. It emits ultrasonic waves and measures the time taken for the waves to bounce back, allowing the robot to detect nearby walls or obstacles.
      
      ii) Infrared (IR) Sensors: These sensors are often used for line following, detecting intersections or determining the robot's position relative to maze walls.

4. ***Actuators:***

       i) DC Motors: These motors are responsible for driving the robot's wheels. They are controlled by the motor driver based on the commands from the Arduino.

5. ***Power Supply:***
       i) Battery: Usually, a rechargeable battery pack or set of batteries powers the robot. It provides the necessary voltage and current for the Arduino, motors and other electronic components.
